## 1. File-by-File Examination Approach

**Objective:** Conduct a systematic review of every file in the codebase to understand functionality, coding standards, and adherence to best practices.

### **Step 1: Prepare the Development Environment**

- **Clone the Repository**
  - Use `git clone` to obtain the latest codebase.
- **Install Dependencies**
  - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all required packages.
- **Set Up Environment Variables**
  - Configure `.env` files based on `.env.example`.
- **Database Setup**
  - Use Prisma to set up the local database:
    - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply migrations.
    - Seed the database if necessary.

### **Step 2: Review Configuration Files**

Begin with critical configuration files to understand global settings:

- **Next.js Configuration**
  - `next.config.js` or `next.config.ts`: Check custom webpack configurations, environment variables, performance optimizations.
- **TypeScript Configuration**
  - `tsconfig.json`: Review compiler options, path aliases, and strictness settings.
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**
  - `tailwind.config.ts`: Examine theme customizations, plugins, and purge options.
- **PostCSS Configuration**
  - `postcss.config.mjs`: Ensure proper PostCSS plugins are used.
- **Playwright Configuration**
  - `playwright.config.ts`: Understand testing configurations.
- **Docker Configuration**
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Examine container setups and services.
- **Additional Configurations**
  - Linting and formatting configs like `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`.

### **Step 3: Examine the `src` Directory**

Delve into the core of the application:

#### **A. Routing and Pages (`/src/app/`)**

- **Review Page Components**
  - Examine top-level pages (Home, Login, Register, Settings, Prompts).
  - Understand the file-based routing structure.
- **Dynamic Routes**
  - Analyze parameterized routes for prompt management.
- **API Routes**
  - Investigate endpoints under `/app/api/`, ensuring RESTful conventions.

#### **B. Components (`/src/components/`)**

- **UI Components (`/src/components/ui/`)**
  - Review base components for reusability and styling consistency.
  - Check for accessibility compliance (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- **Feature-Specific Components**
  - Examine components tied to specific functionalities.
  - Verify separation of concerns and minimal coupling.

#### **C. Contexts and State Management (`/src/contexts/` & `/src/hooks/`)**

- **Context Providers**
  - Understand how global state is managed and provided to components.
- **Custom Hooks**
  - Review hooks for data fetching, state management, and side effects.

#### **D. Utilities and Services (`/src/lib/`)**

- **Services (`/src/lib/services/`)**
  - Examine each service (authentication, AI integration, prompt management) for logic, error handling, and API interactions.
- **Utilities**
  - Review helper functions for opportunities to optimize or consolidate.

#### **E. Types and Interfaces (`/src/types/`)**

- **Type Definitions**
  - Ensure all types and interfaces are comprehensive and accurately represent data structures.
  - Check for any `any` types that can be strictly typed.

### **Step 4: Analyze the `prisma` Directory**

- **Schema (`schema.prisma`)**
  - Review database models, relationships, and enums.
- **Migrations**
  - Examine migration history for consistency and potential issues.
- **Prisma Client Usage**
  - Check for correct and efficient usage of Prisma Client in the codebase.

### **Step 5: Review Public Assets (`/public/` Directory)**

- **Static Assets**
  - Ensure assets are optimized (images compressed, unused assets removed).
- **SEO Considerations**
  - Review metadata, favicon, and robots.txt.

### **Step 6: Inspect Tests (`/tests/` Directory)**

- **Playwright Tests**
  - Assess the coverage and effectiveness of end-to-end tests.
- **Integration and Unit Tests**
  - Identify the presence of unit tests and consider adding Jest or similar frameworks.

### **Step 7: Examine Supporting Files**

- **Documentation Files**
  - Locate and review any existing documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING).
- **Environment and Build Scripts**
  - Review scripts in `package.json` for running, building, and testing the application.
